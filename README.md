# Spiral Floor Lamp
"Unrolled" 3-D spiral floor lamp

Â© 2020, Taylor Lucas Barrett

This industrial design project was created for a digital fabrication class assignment. The purpose of the project was to make a 3-D shape in Rhino, unroll the shape into a 2-D pattern, print/cut the pattern from 2-D material, and then re-assemble the material into a physical copy of the original 3-D object. 

Materials used:

- Large sheets of construction paper
- Spray paint
- Chicken wire (square grid)
- Metal fence post, 6'
- Bolts, washers, and nuts
- Wood (1"x1"x12" for base)
- Colour-changing LED strip tape with power cord
- Wood glue
- Aluminum tape
- Electrical tape
